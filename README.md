# I reused the ToDos project and added more features such as:

*  Saving user information when logging in for the first time and allowing them to edit their avatar and user name.
*  Using web sockets and DynamoDB to implement a real-time chat feature between users.
* I have also deployed my project to CloudFront, and the URL of the website is:
